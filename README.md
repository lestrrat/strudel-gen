# strudel-gen

This project provides the `/compose` skill for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). It includes reference data about [Strudel](https://strudel.cc/) functions, sounds, and mini-notation syntax, enabling Claude Code to generate Strudel live-coding snippets from natural language descriptions.
