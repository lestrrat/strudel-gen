{"token":"[ ]","meaning":"Group / subdivision","desc":"Subdivides a cycle into equal parts for the elements inside the brackets.","example":"\"[bd sd] hh\"","rewrites":["[a b] [a b] → [a b]!2","[x x x x] → x!4 (at top level) or [x!4] (nested)"]}
{"token":"< >","meaning":"Alternation","desc":"Alternates between elements on successive cycles.","example":"\"bd <sd cp>\"","rewrites":["<A A B B> → <A!2 B!2>","<X X X Y> → <X!3 Y>"]}
{"token":"{ }","meaning":"Polymetric sequence","desc":"Creates a polymetric sequence — elements cycle at their own rate over the parent cycle.","example":"\"{bd sd cp, hh hh hh hh}\""}
{"token":"( )","meaning":"Euclidean rhythm","desc":"Distributes n events evenly over k steps using the Euclidean algorithm.","example":"\"bd(3,8)\""}
{"token":"*","meaning":"Speed up / repeat","desc":"Repeats an element n times within its time slot.","example":"\"bd*4 sd\"","rewrites":["Use * for subdivision (faster playback), ! for replication (same speed, more steps)"]}
{"token":"/","meaning":"Slow down","desc":"Plays an element once every n cycles.","example":"\"bd sd/2\""}
{"token":",","meaning":"Parallel / stack","desc":"Plays multiple patterns simultaneously (stacks them).","example":"\"bd sd, hh hh hh hh\""}

{"token":"?","meaning":"Degrade / random drop","desc":"Randomly removes the event with 50% probability (or a given probability).","example":"\"bd sd? hh cp\""}
{"token":"!","meaning":"Replicate","desc":"Repeats the element n times, each taking its own step (unlike * which subdivides).","example":"\"bd!3 sd\"","rewrites":["bd bd bd → bd!3","~ ~ ~ ~ → ~!4","[a b] [a b] [a b] → [a b]!3","[x ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~] → [x ~!7]","<Am Am C C> → <Am!2 C!2>"]}
